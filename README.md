# Mevo Front End Engineer Exercise

## Part 1a: Vehicles on maps

Build a static website (no backend) using React JS that queries the Mevo APIs (specifically the public endpoints ) and displays the position of Mevo vehicles on a map. 


## Part 1b: Improving the map

Extend your map from just displaying the Mevo vehicle pins. Feel free to get as creative as you like in the pursuit of making your website more useful or exciting.


## Part 2: Working as a Software Engineer
In a few paragraphs (or by another method of your choice), tell us about each of the following:
* What has been your favourite place to work so far? What was it about working there that made it
your favourite?
* What’s something that you wish you could have as a part of your job?
* Reading the introduction to Mevo on our developer site, what makes you the most excited about
the potential of working as a Software Engineer here?

## MVP based on user stories
As a user I want to:
* see where the Mevo vehicles are located in Wellington when the page loads.
* see the Home Zones marked on the map when the page loads.
* read answers to Part 2 of the exercise in a modal on the same page.

## Stretch features based on user stories
As a user I want to:
* be able to toggle the Home Zones marks on and off on the map.
* be given navigation directions to a vehicle I click on.

## Tech stack
* create-react-app
* Mapbox GLJS
* Testing: Jest & React Testing Library
* Deployment: GitHub pages/Heroku - TBD

## File structure
* public - index.html, CSS and other assets.
* src - JSX components and tests, utility functions and tests and root JSX and JS files.

## Limitations
* Non-responsive website - best viewed on desktop
* Single page web app - navigation options aren't hyperlinks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
